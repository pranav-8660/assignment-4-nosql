Refer to the MongoDB study material page number 37. Recreate the blog model in MongoDB.

Add necessary data to all collections. At least 5 users, 10 articles and 3 comments for each article.
User collection should have a "credits" field. Assign credits to each user. Initial credits should be between 100-500

Execute the following queries and attach screenshots of the results.

1. Fetch all articles for a given user
2. Fetch users who write articles for a given category
3. Fetch users who write articles for a given Tag.
4. Fetch all the comments for a particular article.
5. Write a query to fetch all articles for the user. Use projection to fetch only the title of each article and not the complete document.
6. Write a query to deduct 50 credits from a particular user. Note: the query should not update the credits field. It should subtract from the value. Post screenshots before and after running the query. 

Post all the queries. Compile all screenshots into a single PDF file and submit it.
